# Psychora

Psychora is a personal psychology learning and reflection web app.

This starter version includes:

- **Dashboard (Home)** — shows current chapter, concepts reviewed, today’s suggestion, recent concepts, and recent reflections.
- **Learn** — concepts grouped by chapter (static placeholder for now).
- **Reflect** — recent reflections list and a button for new reflections (placeholder).
- **Settings** — course info, bulk import description, and theme toggle (light/dark stub).

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the Psychora dashboard.
3. Use `learn.html`, `reflect.html`, and `settings.html` as the basis for wiring up app logic and data.

All styling lives in `style.css` and shared behavior in `app.js`.
